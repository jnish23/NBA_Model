# NBA_Model

## Objective
The purpose of this project is to use historical NBA boxscore data and historical betting odds to build a model that can be profitable against vegas betting lines.
To do this, I will use player level and some team-level statistics with a neural network model. 


## The Data

### Player Data - Player level boxscores for every game from 2010-present
- player_gamelogs
- player_advanced_boxscores
- player_scoring_boxscores
- player_tracking_boxscores

### Team Data - Team level boxscores for every game from 2010-present 
- gamelog
- team_advanced_boxscores
- team_scoring_boxscores
- team_tracking_boxscores

### Betting Data - Spreads and Totals for every game from 2011-present
- betting_data_2010_present

## Results
This projecct is still in progress. This will be updated as I continue to work on it.
